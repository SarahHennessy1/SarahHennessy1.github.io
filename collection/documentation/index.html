<h1>Collection Project Response</h1>
<h2><a href="../index.html">Collection</a></h2>
<p> 
	I created a collection of information about my family. Including vintage family photos, photos from my personal collection and photos saved on the deepest parts of my families computer.

	When the user chooses to start the game they are greeted with a collection of images that when clicked reveal a question about a member of my family.

	The question relates to the person featured in the image. Occasionally the person that is in the image is "cutout" covered in green to conceal either who the question is about or the person's name is the answer to the question.

	The game also features a scoreboard so the users can keep track of the game. This score board also generates teams, fairly splitting all 25 opponents amongst 5 teams.
