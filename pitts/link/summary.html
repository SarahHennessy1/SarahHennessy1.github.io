Age: 34
<br><br>
Located: Brooklyn, NY
<br><br>
School:<br>
Attended MIT for both his undergrad and masters. Both degrees came from the department of aeronautics and astronautics with a minor in Architecture and Visual Art.
Did three year residency after working independently for two years.  Did two years as a regular resident and one year as the “Resident Researcher in Art/Science” at Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten. About his time there he said “The Rijksakademie is not a degree-granting institution but was a crucial part of my education and immersion in art.”
<br><br>
“I am very interested in producing the undocumentable. I’m not really sure what that means or looks like, but that’s why the possibility holds my interest. Again, I’m not sure if the undocumentable can truly occupy a place in our culture, but I think I’d like to live in a society that could fully value the undocumentable.”
