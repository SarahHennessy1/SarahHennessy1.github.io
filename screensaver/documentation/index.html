<p> For my project I took visual inspiration from a fireplace. Growing up my house had a wood burning fireplace that was used for a good 60% of the year due to the long and cold seasons in upstate New York. I always found the flickers of the flames, the changing heights and colors very peaceful. The randomization and slow growth of the flames kept my interest and made for peaceful background.

<br>To start my project I created 8 bars that change to random heights as if mimicking the changing flickering heights of a flame. These height changing bars also are animated with keyframes to continually change the color of the bars to continue the idea that the objects are flickering.

<br>Initially the heights change based on a SetTimeout that allows the speed at which the heights update to continually get faster. This again mimics the style of a fireplace the at first grows slowly but begins to flicker and change very quickly as the fire grows.

<br>The overall height of the piece also changes similar to a real fire. Initially the piece starts out with a max-height of 20% that keeps the flames small and as time continues the pieces mash-height changes to 40% and then 100%.

<br>The fire again will cycle through this process of changing colors, heights and overall max height.</p>
